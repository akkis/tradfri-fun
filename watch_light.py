watch_light.py

Simple script to monitor the status of a Tr√•dfri smart light.
A background thread polls the gateway for the light status and
displays any changes.
Based in part on code from: https://github.com/ggravlingen/pytradfri/

Make you you update the IP address to match your gateway's and
run $ python3 -i -m pytradfri IP to (re)create your
tradfri_standalone_psk.conf (Credentials file)
